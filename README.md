# -Clustering-Algorithm
The objective of this assignment is to evaluate understanding and ability to apply clustering techniques to a real-world dataset.
Here I've used Iris dataset from sklearn library.
It contains 150 rows. As we are working on Unsupervised Dataset, we will not be loading the Target column fro the IRIS Dataset.

Tasks performed- 

loaded iris dataset from sklearn.

data preprocessing-1 duplicate value detected and removed it.No null values here.outliers found but not removed due to small dataset.

Used standard scalar to normalize dataset.

Dimensionality reduction done for plotting 2D graph.

KMeans and Hierarchical Clustering algorithms implemented.

Plotted dendrogram.
